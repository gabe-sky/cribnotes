# Overview

aircrack-ng is the next generation blah blah blah

# Finding and Capturing Traffic

## Put card in monitor mode on a particular channel

  airmon-ng start wlan0 1

## Injection test

https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=injection_test

  aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon  # finds SSIDs and things

## for() loop to change channels, test, move on

  for i in {1..11} ; do airmon-ng start wlan0mon $i ; figlet "${i}" ; aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon ; done

For signal, smaller negative numbers are better, bigger than -65 is bad.

## Snoop only initialization vectors, from all channels, but only associated devices

  airodump-ng -t WPA2 -i -a --berlin 30 -n 10 -w <file prefix> wlan0mon

## Deauth a connected client (to try to see it re-initialize) on the secondary wifi

  airmon-ng start wlan1 <target channel>
  aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <client MAC> wlan1mon
    # 0 = deauth, 1 = once

## Snoop some particular wireless network

  airodump-ng -c <channel> -d <AP MAC> -w <file prefix> wlan0mon

# WPA Cracking

## Run a password file against some AP MAC in some captures

  aircrack-ng -w password.lst -b <AP MAC> <file prefix>*.ivs

# Use ivs tools to merge a bunch of iv files into one

  ivstools --merge pcaps/Flarghies-* pcaps/Flarghies.ivs

# Uodate aircrack's list of MAC addresses, then grep for a prefix, to find the manufacturer
  airodump-ng-oui-update
  grep -A 5 -i XX-XX-XX /usr/share/ieee-data/oui.txt)
