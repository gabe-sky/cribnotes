Installing on kali/debian -- should work elsewhere

# Get the source
  git clone https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3.git
  cd proxmark3

# Just in case you're starting over
make clean

# If you don't have a "real" proxmark3, you need to compile for a "generic" one
# You'll know you've got the wrong one, if you get all the way through this,
# start pm3, and when you do `hw status` it tells you there is a "fw mismatch."
# If you have a "real" one, leave out the PLATFORM=PM3GENERIC from these.
make PLATFORM=PM3GENERIC all
sudo make PLATFORM=PM3GENERIC install
pm3-flash-all


# Start talking to the li'l guy
pm3

# How're we feeling today?
hw status

# If you see an error about a "fw mismatch," go back to the `make clean` step
# and this time specify or omit the PLATFORM= value when running `make`.

# Run a Lua script that finished initializing the thing.
script run init_rdv4
